# Quit Smoking Friend :sparkles: :tada:

This is a desktop virtual friend that helps you quit smoking. You can track how many times you wanted to smoke,
but you chose to hold back as well as how long have you been quit smoking. 

We know at the early stage of quitting smoking, you may not help yourself but keep thinking about wanting a
cigarette, and you need a distraction to help you stop thinking about smoking. This desktop virtual friend
can tell you some jokes to help you distract your thought about smoking.

Moreover, you can check other users'
current thoughts and feeling, and you cna also share your thoughts and feelings with other users.
